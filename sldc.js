let Planning = "In the Planning phase, project leaders evaluate the terms of the project. This includes calculating labor and material costs, creating a timetable with target goals, and creating the project’s teams and leadership structure."
let AnalysisOfRequirements = "Defining requirements is considered part of planning to determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements. "
let Design ="The Design phase models the way a software application will work. Some aspects of the design include:Architecture,User Interface,Platforms,Programming,Communications,Security"
let Implementation ="This is the actual writing of the program. A small project might be written by a single developer, while a large project might be broken up and worked by several teams."
let TestingIntegration ="It’s critical to test an application before making it available to users. Much of the testing can be automated, like security testing."
let Maintain ="In the deployment phase, the application is made available to users. Many companies prefer to automate the deployment phase. "
